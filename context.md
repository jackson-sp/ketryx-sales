## USE CASES

### AI/ML in Medical Devices
**Artificial Intelligence Regulatory Compliance / FDA-Grade AI Compliance in Medical Device Software**
Simplify change management and accelerate development across your AI lifecycle. For many teams, internal processes and tools are the main limiting factors to releasing more frequently. Implementing AI and compliance requires medical device software teams to overcome this challenge.

**AI Regulatory Compliance:** To use AI/ML in medical devices, medical device software teams need to release faster while staying compliant. Advanced AI and ML models can improve the accuracy and reliability of medical devices. But how do you integrate your AI/ML model into your existing software system and design controls? Thanks to the recent PCCP guidance, medical device software teams are no longer constrained by the FDA when it comes to AI/ML.

### Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) and Connected Devices
Reduce the complexity, time, and cost of building Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) applications with the only developer-first connected lifecycle management platform.

**FDA Software as a Medical Device:** Build safe and reliable FDA-compliant SaMD faster. Software is at the core of most medical devices. But today's software landscape is increasingly complex. Methods of the past don't scale for the software of today. Quality and development teams alike are looking for a better way to release faster, safer software, at scale.

**Documentation – Accelerate SaMD releases:** Software developers new to safety-critical environments often struggle to integrate modern software development methodology with the documentation required to ensure patient safety and regulatory compliance.

Quote: *"We spoke to dozens of quality experts and nobody ever made anything clear to us. The team at Ketryx did. For the first time, they helped us really understand how to develop compliant software. With Ketryx, our team is truly happy and productive."* — Alec Winograd, VP of Engineering at Oui Therapeutics

**Higher productivity. Greater control.** Designed with built-in compliance, Ketryx integrates with DevTools like Jira and GitHub and transforms them to create a self-documenting, self-enforcing, and self-tracing software development lifecycle.

### Compliance Software for Jira – Transform Jira into IEC 62304 compliance
Make Jira, the most widely used project management platform for software development worldwide, work for you. Jira was not designed for regulated development. Teams using Jira face issues with: maintaining immutable records and electronic signatures; enforcing control over Total Product Life Cycle (TPLC); validating the Non-Product Software (NPS) toolchain; tracing across other systems; visibility into validated Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

**IEC 62304 Compliance for Jira:** Transform Jira into a validated, compliant platform for medical device development. Ketryx transforms Jira into a compliant platform for medical device development, no bespoke customizations or expensive consultants needed.

**Traceability:** Ketryx ensures seamless traceability, allowing you to track every aspect of your product's lifecycle — from user requirements to specs to tests — while you're working in Jira. Track every change with end-to-end traceability across the entire product lifecycle. Easily view dependencies and relationships between requirements, specifications, tasks, risks, and tests through the traceability widget in Jira.

**Enforcement:** Ketryx enforces your SOPs in Jira so your developers' work stays compliant. Gate releases and approvals in a way that aligns with your quality processes (e.g. V&V tests won't run for uncontrolled requirements or unapproved test cases). Prevent unauthorized or untrained personnel from approving. Once approved, items are immutable to prevent process deviation.

**Preferred DevTools – Part 11-compliant signatures in Jira:** Keep your developers in Jira with Part 11-compliant secure and legally binding electronic signatures within Jira. Electronic signatures meet 21 CFR Part 11 requirements. Be audit-ready by ensuring all electronic records are authenticated, authorized, and tamper-proof.

**Documentation – Automated document generation:** Automatically transform the work you do in Jira into compliant documentation. Ketryx automates evidence collection and documentation creation directly from Jira, eliminating tedious manual documentation. Every Jira ticket and change is automatically used to create a Part 11-compliant audit trail. Automatically generated documents are structured to meet IEC 62304 requirements so that you're audit-ready. Ketryx validates Jira to its intended use as a service, providing you documentation of the Jira validation.

**Risk Management in Jira:** Ketryx integrates IEC 62304 and ISO 14971-compliant risk management features into your Jira platform. Track and evaluate risks continuously; establish traceability, all in Jira. Identify and manage risks throughout the development process with risk mitigation integrated into every stage.

### Medical Device Component Reuse Software
Accelerate development with component reuse and systems of systems. Save money and get your medical device to market faster with a modular approach. Without the ability to reuse validated components and manage them independently, teams spend excessive time and resources rebuilding the same elements, tracking changes, and generating documentation. This delays time to market and increases costs.

**System of Systems Architecture for Medical Devices:** Ketryx enables a system of systems architecture, allowing regulated software teams to reuse components while managing their versions independently. This reduces complexity, accelerates release cycles, and ensures compliance with regulatory standards. By breaking down monolithic architectures into modular, reusable systems (e.g. microservices), Ketryx allows teams to develop faster and with fewer defects, all while maintaining end-to-end traceability.

### Artificial Intelligence Regulatory Compliance – AI-Enabled Compliance for GxP Software
Simplify change management and accelerate development across your AI lifecycle. For many teams, internal processes and tools are the main limiting factors to releasing AI-driven innovations faster. Implementing AI/ML in regulated environments requires pharma and biotech teams to overcome these challenges while maintaining compliance with GxP standards.

**AI Regulatory Compliance:** To use AI/ML in GxP environments, teams must scale innovation while staying compliant. Advanced AI and ML models can enhance drug discovery, clinical trials, and manufacturing processes. But how do you integrate your AI/ML models into your existing validated systems and quality frameworks? Recent advancements in AI regulation provide opportunities for pharma companies to innovate responsibly.

### Change Impact Assessment
Simplify change, reduce errors, and move faster with confidence. Managing change in regulated product development is complex. Even small updates can ripple across requirements, tests, risks, and documentation, making manual Change Impact Assessment slow, inconsistent, and difficult to scale. Ketryx replaces document-by-document DHF reviews with AI-assisted, traceability-driven workflows that help teams quickly understand impact, take action, and stay compliant as products evolve.

A small change can cascade across requirements, tests, risks, and documentation. Teams often spend days manually tracing these dependencies across fragmented tools. Ketryx helps teams manage change with AI-powered impact scoping, analysis, and deterministic flagging.

**Case study (Medical Diagnostics Leader):** An innovative AI-driven diagnostics company uses Ketryx's AI-native compliance platform to generate hardware and software change impact assessments in hours, a task that took up to 15 FTE days per change previously. Using Ketryx resulted in a 70% reduction in documentation drafting time and review effort for hardware and software changes.

Ketryx supports Change Impact Assessment through: analyze scope and dependencies; take action to apply changes; flag potential downstream impacts. **Analyze Changes in Minutes:** The Ketryx Assistant helps teams identify up to 80% of impacted areas in minutes, replacing manual review with AI-powered analysis. Identifies impacted requirements, tests, and documentation across the DHF; surfaces upstream causes and downstream consequences; reduces initial impact analysis from days to minutes with traceable, audit-ready insights. **Turn Analysis into Action:** The agent guides teams through change impact assessment workflows with concrete, traceable recommendations, reducing manual effort by up to 70% and completing assessments in hours instead of weeks. Guides teams through structured, consistent workflows; translates identified impacts into clear actions; maintains full traceability from change to decision. **Flag Affected Design Controls:** Ketryx proactively flags downstream design controls affected by changes, giving teams early visibility. Adds visual flags to impacted DHF items; provides early awareness without forcing action; reduces overlooked changes before formal change impact assessment begins.

### Traceability to Automated Tests
IEC 62304-compliant traceability to automated tests for safer medical device software. When your automated tests live in Git, but your test cases live in Jira, developers are forced to manually document automated test cases to ensure traceability. Ketryx enables developers to use Git the way they want while automatically generating compliant documentation. Automatically trace automated tests in Git to requirements in Jira. Establish traceability between automated test cases in Git and the corresponding requirements or change requests. By continuously monitoring software dependencies for vulnerabilities, Ketryx helps prevent releases with unapproved dependencies. Before a product version can be released in Ketryx, all requirements and other configuration items need to trace to tests and show satisfactory results.

### Multiple Function Device Validation – FDA-Grade AI Compliance for System of Systems
Release device and non-device functions independently with a system of systems architecture. With Ketryx, teams avoid all-or-nothing releases: release non-device functions independently without re-validating the entire device; version device and non-device functions separately; reduce redundant validation cycles; maintain patient safety with risk-based controls and traceability. FDA guidance allows MedTech companies to separate device functions from non-device functions in multifunction devices. In practice, most companies can't take advantage because of monolithic product architecture, the structure of their design controls, and their QMS. A small change to a non-device function can trigger a full re-validation of the entire system. Ketryx addresses this.

## NOTES FROM PRODUCT DEMO

**Positioning:** AI-native compliance platform for teams developing regulated software. We help multiple personas: R&D and developers who want to use preferred tools and not become compliance experts; QA and Regulatory Affairs who own compliance and documentation; systems engineers and Program Managers who deal with complex large systems.

**Problem:** Keeping up with the pace of modern software dev when there are bottlenecks around documentation and compliance. Teams spend weeks–months after the product is done to produce required documentation, which slows down shipping. Various modern SW dev tools, compliance tools, meetings and docs need to come together.

**Demo flow:** Connects into commonly used dev tools like Jira, GitHub, Azure DevOps. We automatically collect evidence of compliance from those tools and enforce your process back into those tools. **All Items screen:** Single source of truth that brings relevant documentation from different systems (Jira, Git, ALM tools e.g. Polarium, requirements management e.g. Jama). **Release screen:** Command center/dashboard showing progress and compliance deliverables. **Natural language checklist:** Alternative to traditional SOPs (hundreds of pages); Ketryx embeds those controls directly into your tools. **Documents:** Generate documents; deliverables that typically take months are downloaded automatically (e.g. Systems Requirements Specification – pulls requirements from Polarium, SW documentation from Jira, test evidence from Git). **Change Request:** Items are operated in other systems; change requests managed in Jira where teams live. Ketryx embeds compliance into Jira. **Traceability:** For every change, understand requirements impacted and risks that might be introduced; Ketryx brings that info into your tool.

**AI agents:** Understand the context of your product, your internal SOPs, regulations, standards. AI assistant helps decide when to schedule a change or not, what the risk might be. We have underlying prompts tuned to this particular product. The agent can do change impact analysis on a change request: explore the project, read every requirement and risk, SOP that talk about change management, and output a template for review (change request description, impacted requirements, new requirements, risks, tooling needs). The assistant can provide a first draft of the change plan – a 90% draft of the change impact assessment document. We inject into your existing system and SOP (your QMS) and launch into use cases; all the data is already there. We can add value on day 1. Teams often find they have a 3–6% gap in traceability (requirements not implemented or tested). Trace matrices can be 10K rows long. **Generating Documents:** Work off the change plan with the Assistant to make updates; it makes suggestions and can automatically push into the relevant system (e.g. Jira). **Traceability Matrix:** Hard to maintain for many; we automatically generate this matrix and put a layer of control over it, showing where there are gaps.
